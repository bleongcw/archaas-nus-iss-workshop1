    "This assignment focuses on two main scenarios:\n",
    "* Tool Use with Wikipedia: Implementing function calling with Wikipedia integration\n",
    "** AI Agent Development: Creating specialized agents using OpenAI Agents SDK\n",

    "## Assignment Structure\n",
    "Part 1: Tool Use with Wikipedia Integration \n",
    "Objective: Create a research assistant that can search Wikipedia and provide comprehensive information using OpenAI's function calling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "* Wikipedia Search Function: Implement a function to search Wikipedia articles\n",
    "* Content Extraction: Extract and summarize article content\n",
    "* Function Calling: Use OpenAI's function calling to integrate Wikipedia data\n",
    "* Structured Output: Return information in a structured format\n",
    "* Error Handling: Handle cases where articles don't exist or are ambiguous\n",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",
      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).
